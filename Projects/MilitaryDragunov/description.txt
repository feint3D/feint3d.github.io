Military Dragunov
---
I have always loved the design of this marksman rifle, so I decided to create it for a 3rd year University assignment. Despite there being multiple variants of the SVD I decided to stick with the military version to give it a history through usage of damaged textures and some subtle sculpted dents.

Throughout the project I improved my speed with the ZBrush Polish workflow, tackling some complex shapes and learning to create highly efficient UVs as well as increasing texel density through mirrored UVs on areas that did not need unique details. I sped up my UV unwrapping workflow tenfold through the use of some specific keybinds and ZenUV tools.
