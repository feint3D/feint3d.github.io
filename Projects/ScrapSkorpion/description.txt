Scrap Skorpion
---
I came across an image of this scrap metal recreation of the Skorpion SMG on Pinterest and instantly wanted to recreate it in 3D. I made a few design changes to make it a functional weapon and fit into a post-apocalyptic setting, for example a mag release screw, mag spring, makeshift irons and internals.
