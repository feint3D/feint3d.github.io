I'm Max, also known as Feint, a 23 year-old aspiring weapon and prop artist from the UK. I am proficient in a variety of aspects in 3D asset creation with the ultimate goal of high-quality, attractive, believable and game-ready assets that have mindful optimisation and seamlessly intergrates into the game engine, or animators hands. With a deep-rooted passion for growth and learning in this field, I am driven to proactively learn and hone my skills from all sources of expertise and contribute meaningfully to every project I am apart of. I am especially drawn towards makeshift and unique design elements, as well as texturing to bring character and storytelling into my work.
