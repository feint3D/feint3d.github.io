I'm Max, also know as Feint, a 23 year-old aspiring weapon and prop artist. I am profficienct in a wide range of aspects of 3D asset creation with the ultimate goal of high-quality, attractive and game-ready assets that have mindful optimisation and seamlessly intergrates with the rest of the team e.g animators. 

I am constantly honing my skills and looking to grow as an artist alongside others. I have a particularly powerful attraction towards makeshift and unique design elements, as well as texturing to bring character and storytelling into my work.
